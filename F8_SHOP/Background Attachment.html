        <h1>The background-attachment Property</h1>

        <p>The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page).</p>

        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you do not see any scrollbars, try to resize the browser window.</p>
